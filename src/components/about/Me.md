welcome to my little corner in the digital sea~

online, i usually go by mocha8686, or mocha for short. the name originally came from a character from this mobile rhythm game called bang dream (sometimes called bandori). i didn't even play the game much, and when i did, i always skipped the story; i just thought she was cute. the name had stuck ever since though, and i think it's cute in its own right.

this is the second version of my site, designed by my awesome bf mistakemp4 ([check out his website!](https://mistakemp4.neocities.org/)). i wanted this one to have more of its own identity, rather than just having a vague sci-fi/cyberpunk aesthetic. i was struggling to come up with any kind of design for so long, and i was just looking for inspiration anywhere and everywhere but nothing really stuck; i had so many pinterest tabs open oml...

eventually, after like a week of just scrolling neocities and pinterest, my bf asked if he could help design something for me. i happily said yes and i sent over my 50 tabs of pins and neocities sites, and then later that same day, he sent me this prototype layout.

*looks a lot more blue*

i decided to make it pink to match mizuki, and so along with a few small tweaks, i have a website i'm very happy with! of course, it's far from done. however, i've got some cool plans for the future, so make sure to check back later.

						this is a little site i made as an escape from the
						soulless world of modern websites. as a pursuer of a
						computer science degree, i've been dealing with myriad
						flat and boring designs, endless advocates of the newest
						ai model, and overall, a loss of culture and
						individuality that defined the birth of the internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						i wasn't into the "y2k" stuff when it was still around
						(so sad, i knowâ€”i only hopped on the gay train way later
						too), but i admire it so much for not being afraid to be
						itself. it shines brightly in a world of nihilism and
						dull conformity, and that is what i aspire to do one
						day, whether i am that light for a whole community or
						even just one person. so, let this be my part to keep
						this culture alive~
					</p>

					<p>
						i'll be sharing my thoughts here about how i'm feeling,
						whatever i'm hyperfixed on at the moment, and maybe
						other small posts, which you can find on the sidebar.
					</p>

					<p>
						if you're not sure where to go, check out the sitemap in
						the directory. take a look and find a cool page!

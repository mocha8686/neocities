i watched the prosekai movie this weekend and oh my GOD?? it was so goooodddd!!!! i and everyone else like screamed when saki came up and i was like *omg omg they're ANIME and they're MOVING* but like not in a live2d way but in like an anime way and oh my god it was just sooo cool to see everyone like that

i heard screeching from the top row when L/n luka and len came up on screen and i was like lol that's so silly but i can't even make fun of them because the way i **shook** when i saw MIZUKI WOW!!!!

to be honest, the pacing was genuinely really good like i didn't think the movie was too fast with anything (though of course it was still a little speedy overall since it's a movie), nor was it slogging through any one story beat, and also i think every group had pretty equal screentime which is great~ (but also i NEED more anime mizuki plsplspls)

seeing everyone's antics was also just soo cool, especially seeing them play out on the big screen, like L/n with their absolutely *beautiful* sekai, MMJ and haruka and silly little minori and their idol training, WxS and *tsukasa* (and also emu and nene and rui and i love them all!!), VBS and kohane's funny hat (tbh i didn't get around to their first story before going to the movie), and N25 and mizuki!!! and ofc ena and her grudge against akito and and mafuyu who (i think) makes kanade food for her and kanade who always forgets to eat it anyways~ (can you tell who my favorite group is‚Äì)

the songs were SO GOOD TOO like i was genuinely enjoying all of them, especially when ichika was playing her silly little guitar song on the street it was like magical?? and then N25's song at the end, *the light that dwells here*‚Äînow that i think about it, the beginning really reminds me of that one splatoon song that plays at the end at the credits and that like xylophone-synth sound is really nostalgic for some reason, i love it!!!

the way i was VIBRATING when *SToRY* came on though??? like it was SO GOOD and i was **bangin** my head in the theater, i felt the energy pouring from the screen like i was really there listening to their concert and the guitars and drums were shaking my bones

i would be lying if i said i didn't let a few tears roll down my face in the theater up to this point ü•π but the way *hello, SEKAI* had me sobbing??? like seeing miku flying around and everyone being happy and the lyrics were actually beating my ass and i literally could not read them bc of the tears in my eyes????

also the live show was so cool!!! like i never would have thought of doing that but it works so well (also not the whole theater just laughing at miku trying to get us to sing with her in japanese)

god. i love this movie so much and now i just want to blast through all of the stories in prosekai. it also just had the perfect timing with the message it gave to its audience, and it was really one i needed to hear. i won't spoil too much more in case u haven't seen the movie bc it's **so worth it** so watch it when you can!

wonderhoy~

(also when i parked my car immediately 4 queers decked out in miku expo merch walked in front of my car and i was like *omg i am not ready for this huh*‚Äîalso not me walking out of the bathroom after the movie and almost running into miku and len LMAO‚Äîdude i was in a rush to piss like the movie was WAY longer than i thought; there were like 3 times i thought it was about to end but then no they introduce a whole nother plot point and arc?? but oh well more movie for me nyehehehe)

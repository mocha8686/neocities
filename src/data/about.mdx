# About

welcome, internet surfer~

this is a little site i made as an escape from the soulless world of modern websites. as a pursuer of a computer science degree, i've been dealing with myriad flat and boring designs, endless advocates of the newest ai model, and overall, a loss of culture and individuality that defined the birth of the internet.

i also want this site to be as light as possible. in our modern age, developers guzzle javascript into their webpages, often under pressure by project managers and shareholders and companies trying to save their own asses, so almost every website you visit nowadays shoves a popup in your face asking you if you want their cookies, starts autoplaying a video you would've never wanted to see in the first place, asks if you want to talk with their ai chatbot, and it's just so draining to browse the internet now.

even if you're just looking for a simple answer to a question you had, you might be stuck loading ten megabytes of javascript on your shitty data just to be met with popups that take way too long to close, and you might not even find the answer you were looking for in the first place! that's why i'm limiting the javascript in my website as much as possible, and [astro](https://astro.build) has been such a great tool to help with this. i miss when webpages were snappy, so i'm making mine just as fast as they were before.

i wasn't into the "y2k" stuff when it was still around (so sad, i know—i only hopped on the gay train way later too), but i admire it so much for not being afraid to be itself. it shines brightly in a world of nihilism and dull conformity, and that is what i aspire to do one day, whether i am that light for a whole community or even just one person. so, let this be my part to keep this culture alive~

i'll be sharing my thoughts here about how i'm feeling, whatever i'm hyperfixed on at the moment, and maybe other small posts, which you can find on the sidebar.

if you're not sure where to go, [check out the sitemap](/sitemap). take a look and find a cool page!

P.S. go visit [my bf's page](https://mistakemp4.neocities.org)!!! 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅

## hello, blog!

welcome to my new home for all of my weird little ramblings. on my old site, i had a microblog to use like a twitter feed or discord server. however, i stopped updating it after a little while becuase it started to feel like such a chore to update my entire website just for a tiny paragraph or two.

this time, i'm trying out a more longform blog, and hopefully, it'll motivate me to actually post on it for once.

honestly, i never was one to post my thoughts online, but something about it was always appealing to me. maybe it was how people were able to communicate their emotions, or maybe it was the lives that other people lived that i loved seeing. either way, i never actually enjoyed posting on like reddit or (old) twitter; it just felt like throwing my writing onto a template. every post blended together, the same sans-serif white text on a solid blue-black background, a toolbar with buttons to like, dislike, comment, save, reply, et cetera. social media jsut feels like assimilation.

this is one of the biggest reasons for starting this website. i wanted to throw my words onto a canvas i painted myself. make it look pretty, make it look cute, make it look *me*.

so welcome, internet stranger, and i hope you have a good time perusing my brain.

p.s. look at this creature

I'm going to get scared again...
I'm going to want to run away...
But...
I want to feel like I belong...!
I still want us to be friends...!
That's all I've ever wanted...!
But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't tell you...!
Is it really okay for someone like me...to be friends with you?!
I'm gonna cause you a lot of trouble...!
I might end up having really bad days...!
But I wanna stay...!
I wanna keep belonging...!
I want us to stay friends...!

i switched my site from astro to 11ty, so that was fun lmao

the astro devtools were making my computer crash out, and i literally couldn't use it anymore; although, in retrospect, it might've been my nvim configuration and stylelint, soooo.......

but oh well, it's already doneâ€”besides, i do actually like 11ty for a lot of different reasons anyways so i think it was worth it
